- Proposals are created by the DAO owner and contain a title and description.
- Users can vote on proposals using their NFT voting rights.
- Once all voters have cast their votes, the proposal is closed, and the result is calculated.
- The proposal passes if the number of "yes" votes is greater than the number of "no" votes.
- DAO owner has the ability to increase the total supply of NFTs.
- Please refer to the smart contract code for more details on the implementation and specific rules.
